Final project 480a, spring 2013

Description:

Make your own scale. You can listen to the different scales. The less notes you use the easier it is to hear the difference.The sage worksheet (or sagecloud) should be used to run through the program. It's heavily commented.

Motivations:

A musical tone is made up of a waveform, this waveform is a complex tone. The structure is as follows: for a tone of frequency f, the tone is made up of the complex tone consisting of varying amplitudes of f, 2f, 3f... nf,.... These are called the 1st through nth harmonics (or partials or overtones; there is no consistantsy with usage). Interestingly, the variation of amplitudes amongst the harmonics is how we can differentiate between two musical instruments that are playing the same note. 

Intervals are two notes (tones of different frequency) played simultaneously. An interval is considered consonant if the higher harmonics of both tones roughly line up. This can be heard as a clear interval when listening to music. This is made clear with an interval with base tone frequency f, and higher tone (not harmonic) frequency 3f/2.
