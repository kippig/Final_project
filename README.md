Final project 480a, spring 2013

Description:
Sage has minimal functionality for axiomatic set theory computing. In fact, while symbolic logic is supported, there are no universal quantifiers, and the symbolic logic section does not support sets. 

Goals (as difficulty permits):
1. create a system that can evaluate universal and existential quantifiers.
2. intoduce set theory into this system, namely "element of". (in axiomatic set theory every thing is a set).
3. Lastly, if the first 2 task prove easy, create a program, that will accept your axiomatic set theory proof in formal logic, and confirm each step.
4. If there's time, a defintion translator will be attached so you can do element-minimal, and ordered pairs without using their first order bare logic definitions.

P.S, I don't expect to be able to have this "sage implemental" ready by the time I turn it in, but it could be something done for fun later. Also, I realize that this has little computational use, but it seems like an awesomely fun thing to do.
